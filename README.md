**<h3 style="color:#FFC733">Overview</h3>** 
This project takes advantage of the blockchain's secure, verified and distributed    
ledger to manage inventory, verifying the supply chain of goods, and limiting anyone's    
ability to intentionally manipulate the price of goods by faking scarcity.       
<p>&nbsp;</p> 

**<h3 style="color:#FFC733">Seller</h3>** 
A supplier's inventory is recorded in the ledger and visible to all blockchain nodes for consensus.   
Consumers elect to purchase from suppliers who participate in this system of transparency and accountability.     
As consumers purchase a good, the ledger is updated via a Smart Contract and the updated the stock values are recealed.    
of the supplier from wreaking havoc and raising prices  articifically by claiming they are out of stock.    
When a user purchases from this vendor, the ledger is updated, subtrating what was purchased from the   
vendor's inventory and the inventory ledger is updated via a Smart Contract on the blockchain.
<p>&nbsp;</p> 

If vendor makes fake claims, they will get punished by being expelled from participation in the ledger.      
Consumers are protected from manipulation.

**<h3 style="color:#FFC733">User Workflow:</h3>** 
  1. users will have to register and sign in to access the store
  2. a user will see the inventory quantity in real time
  3. once they select an amount of product they would like to buy, they will see the inventory update   
     in real time, by the power of the smart contract
