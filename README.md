**<h3 style="color:#FFC733">Overview</h3>** 
It comes as no shock that it’s common practice in some businesses and industries to overstate the scarcity of a certain item in order to spike demand and perceived value. This project provides a safe and secure way for buyers of commodities (fuel, medical and household goods, etc.) to make purchases with transparency about the seller’s available inventory at a previously locked in price and locked in quantities (DECLARED INVENTORY). This is especially useful for buyers during periods of crisis. The application takes  advantage of the blockchain's secure, verified and distributed ledger to manage inventory, verifying the supply chain of goods and limiting anyone’s ability to intentionally manipulate pricing by faking scarcity.       
<p>&nbsp;</p> 

**<h3 style="color:#FFC733">Seller</h3>** 
The supplier must record both the price and quantity of their inventory six months before it is available for sale. At that point, both price and inventory are locked in regardless of future market conditions. 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 

**<h3 style="color:#FFC733">Buyer</h3>** 
Consumers elect to purchase from suppliers who participate in this system of transparency and accountability. As consumers purchase a good, the ledger is updated via Smart Contract and the updated stock values are revealed to all buyers. Inventory pricing and quantities are constantly verified over time making it very difficult to artificially manipulate their values. This secure marketplace for goods, especially in countries with uncertain market conditions, will attract a critical mass of buyers who prefer to make verified purchases thus putting pressure on suppliers to participate in the marketplace.   
<p>&nbsp;</p> 

**<h3 style="color:#FFC733">Safeguards</h3>** 
If a vendor makes fake claims, they will get punished by being expelled from participation in the marketplace. Their profits will be slashed.          
<p>&nbsp;</p> 

**<h3 style="color:#FFC733">MVP</h3>** 
MVP only deals with the buyer side of the process. It presumes that the seller side is already present. 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 

**<h3 style="color:#FFC733">User Workflow</h3>** 
  1. users will have to register and sign in to access the store
  2. a user will see the DECLARED INVENTORY and price as well as the current stock availability 
  3. once they elect how much product they want to buy, users will see the inventory update in real time
